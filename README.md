# Older projects repository
This is a repo with a few projects I built in high-school. Given the fact that this is the beginning of my development journey, the code needs a lot of improvement. However, this repo offers a great perspective of the evolution in coding style and problem solving. 
For the purpose of learning, I used multiple programming languages to familiarize myself with **different paradigms** (imperative/declarative) and **diverse acts of compiling** types (AOT/JIT)
> **Note:**  Most projects here haven't been updated in the last 3 years, so some of them might need some tweaking to work properly. 

### Here is a list with the main projects and a short description for each one
